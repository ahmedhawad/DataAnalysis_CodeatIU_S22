I will go over 2 main things to help you practially build AI algorithms.

There are many many things to cover, I will cover a 
small subscetion of 2 very import skills:

    -Recursion
        -Once you get the hang of it, it'll be one of the most  
        powerful tools you will have as a programmer
        
    -Using ML libraries
        -These are simple to use but difficult to master
