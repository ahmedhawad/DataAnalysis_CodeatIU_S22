Using what you learned from the previous weeks, 
you will graphing solo or in small groups, your choice!


For your reference I added a completed file in pulling_graphing_cleaning.py


Tasks:
    a) Graph a point map of everyone's favorite restaurant
        -Title of restaurant as title 
        -Include the food type when you hover (look at plotly docs to find how to do this)
        -Include recommender's name when you hover
        -Make it a dark map

    b) Graph everyone's hometown location as a line map connected to bloomington
        -Clean the data to put it in your desired format
            -Feel free to use your own way or the method I used 
        -Add the person's name as the title
        -Include peron's funny oneliner when you hover
        -Make it an outdoors map



Goals:

- Getting comfortable writing code solo by completting Tasks(shown above)
- Pulling Data from a csv 
- Learning to graph via code
- Reading API documentation
- Transforming and cleaning data
