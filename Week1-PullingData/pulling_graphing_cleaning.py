Welcome to Week 1

This week we will practice:
    - Reading and writing data from files we have stored locally and from the internet
    - Cleaning data to match our criteia
    - Graphing everything on a map

I will go through examples for each as a code along, then I will give you a dataset to practice by yourself.


Steps:

1. Complete this survey:


2. Download 
    - pandas
    - plotly

        How to Download:
            -For windows go to command prompt and type in "pip install [library name]"  and don't include the brackets or quotations
            -For mac go to terminal and type in "pip3 install [library name]"  and don't include the brackets or quotations


        More info about the libraries:
            pandas: https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/index.html#user-guide
            plotly: https://plotly.com/python/
            

3. Follow the code along
    - Stop me anytime for explanations
    - Ask questions!!!!!!


4. Work on the survey data solo or in groups

    a) Graph a point map of everyone's favorite restaurant
        -Title of restaurant as title 
        -Include the food type when you hover 
        -Include recommender's name when you hover
        -Make it a dark map

    b) Graph everyone's hometown location as a line map connected to bloomington
        -Clean the data to put it in your desired format
            -Feel free to use your own way or the method I used 
        -Add the person's name as the title
        -Make it an outdoors map
